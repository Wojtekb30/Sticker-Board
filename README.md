# Sticker-Board
A sticker board app, originally made for use with Discord.

Use button visible in the window to create new stickers. Chosen images will be converted to PNG files, 150x150 pixels big. I discovered that this image size renders the same size as other stickers on Discord. 

The resizing to 150x150 is very primitive, make sure the image file you are adding is already a square.

The program created "images" folder, in which it stores the stickers.

Click on a image inside the program to copy it to clipboard. Now you can paste it for example on Discord.
